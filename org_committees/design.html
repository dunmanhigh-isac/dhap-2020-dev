            <p>Tze Zhao is a JC2 student with spontaneous bursts of energy and ideas that often end up becoming an over engineered
            solution to a problem that never existed. When listening to music, he enjoys browsing reddit when he is, in fact,
            supposed to be studying. He hopes that participants will have a fulfilling time competing in DHAP Writes! 2020.
