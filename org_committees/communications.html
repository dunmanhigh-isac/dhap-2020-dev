            <p>Yikun is a Year 6 student from Dunman High School. He loves cross talking during debates and hates passing notes. He
            hopes that the participants at DHAP Writes! 2020 will not be like him. He also hopes that participants will have a
            fulfilling experience participating in DHAP Writes! 2020.

            <h3 id="chair">Chair</h3>

            <p>Jemma is a Year 5 student from the International and Strategic Affairs Council in Dunman High School. She prides herself
            in her extensive knowledge of Netflix shows, and slightly contrarian mindset - like taking H2 Physics when 90% of her
            friend population takes H2 Biology, or choosing not to do the Renegade dance in front of a camera. As a newbie to the
            MUN circuit, she does not have any accolades to boast about, but is definitely excited to mark this year’s DHAP Writes!
            2020 as the start of her enriching and stimulating journey!

            <p>Wei Lun is an ambivert who seems unapproachable at first glance. Get to know him and you would wish you never did in the
            first place. He wishes all participants a fruitful experience at DHAP Writes! 2020.
