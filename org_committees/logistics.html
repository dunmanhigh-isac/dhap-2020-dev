            <p>Jun Hang is a carefree student in his final year in JC, who is extremely open to talking to strangers on
                the street. In
                his free time outside of studying for tests and his personal gratification, he enjoys playing sports and
                roaming the net
                for youtube videos.

            <h2>Lecia Cheok Yun Zhen</h2>
            <h3 id="chair">Chair</h3>

            <p>A snoozing pendulum in lectures by day, and a procrastinator pulling her hair out at math problems by
                night, Lecia is a
                Year 5 student who was introduced to the world of MUN at UNASMUN’17. In her free time, she can be found
                communicating
                with her friends with memes, or doing the renegade dance in her head. Despite being a huge fan of
                self-deprecating
                humour, she believes in truly believing in oneself to achieve more. She hopes that DHAP Writes! 2020
                sprinkles in a dash
                of growth and a tablespoon of fun in participants’ lives.</p>

                learning experience
                for participants in DHAP Writes!. He hopes that participants will be able to take away something from
                DHAP Writes! 2020.
