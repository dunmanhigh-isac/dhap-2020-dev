                <p>Shireen is a Year 6 student studying Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and History. That one cup of coffee every day is
                absolutely necessary, contrary to what her friends believe. During her free time, she likes to binge watch Friends or
                pick up a historical novel. Through DHAP Writes! 2020, she hopes that participants will look at this as an opportunity
                to find comfort in these uncertain times and forge meaningful friendships!

                <p>Sarah is a little upset. She had a decent caption prepared, but she unfortunately, has to rewrite one. All is well
                though, for she feels very happy to have played a part in the organisation of DHAP Writes! 2020, and believes that
                taking part in this competition is the write thing to do! Promotional message aside, Sarah knows that everyone is having
                a rough time, and wishes anyone reading this happiness and good health</p>

                Writes! 2020, she hopes that apart from writing a concise policy paper, participants can also develop a sense of empathy
                towards their community and be inspired to make a positive change.

                <p>Ashley just ran her 2.4KM on the same day as the photoshoot, which explains why she probably looks more frazzled than
                usual. When not spending (most of) her time on MUNs, she can be found playing with her dog (his name is Billy!),
                binge-watching Friends or studying Literature (only). Feel free to approach her any time if you want to talk about
                anything non-Math related because that is her sworn enemy! She is also a McGriddle connoisseur.

Having chaired the Historical Crisis Committee at DHAP 2018, Amanda is honoured to be serving as the Secretary-General for the conference this year. Beyond MUN, Amanda enjoys tofu stew, fried squid and watching videos of baby sloths climbing. She also likes interacting with stray cats, who hopefully reciprocate her feelings. She hopes that delegates will not only emerge from the conference with academic fruitions, but also meaningful friendships with fellow delegates.</p>

<p>Nicholas is a Year 6 student who, like every other student in his cohort, is suffering from the shackles of the A levels. Nicknamed “Winnie the Pooh” by his Economics tutor, he as admitted that he shares many uncanny similarities with it (including looks). Like how Pooh made his last appearance in the Christopher Robin movie, DHAP 2020 would be Nicholas’ swan song. In school, he is usually seen struggling to stay awake during lectures as well as attempting to cope with his infinite number of commitments! He is aware that MUN is more often than not a very nerve-wracking experience, but believes that there is still much to gain from it. He looks forward to seeing delegates have a fruitful and enjoyable time during council.</p>

<p>Belinda is a Y6 Arts student from an empowering all-girl class, and contrary to speculation that she does such a subject combination of History, Economics, E.Literature and Math due her being inept at Sciences (though she doesn’t deny that fact), she actually loves studying them. Known to be witty, sassy and fiery despite her smaller size that makes her susceptible to being lost in a crowd often, Belinda also enjoys learning about new issues, engaging in literature and the Arts, watching adorable dog videos, as well as funny and political memes amidst her hectic schedule. Lastly, as part of the Special Programs Committee, Belinda also looks forward to facilitating the delivery of a more fulfilling and memorable DHAP experience for the delegates this year!</p>
