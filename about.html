<p>The Dunman High Model ASEAN Plus Summit (DHAP) is the flagship event of Dunman High School’s International and Strategic Affairs Council (ISAC) with a trademark on ASEAN. The summit brings together about 200 young people from the Southeast Asian region and beyond. Delegates engage in intellectually stimulating debates on pertinent regional and global issues that revolve around the United Nations and ASEAN. Through a series of debates, six councils ranging from regional to international committees will come up with realistic solutions to resolve issues faced by the world. Organised by ISAC members annually, DHAP has been and continues to be a key platform for ISAC members to develop their leadership potential, enrich their global perspective, and forge meaningful friendships with like-minded youth outside of Dunman High School.</p>

<p>The Dunman High School ASEAN Plus Summit (DHAP) is a flagship event of the International and Strategic Affairs Council.
With many youth participants locally and abroad, DHAP aims to engage young people today in intellectually stimulating
discussions pertaining to regional and international issues. Delegates are expected to hone a greater understanding of
complex issues and critically craft a plausible resolution, taking into account the interests of various stakeholders.
With a variety of issues covered across six different councils, DHAP hopes to provide delegates with an opportunity to
broaden their worldview. Organised by ISAC annually since 2008, ISACers are also provided with the opportunity to
stretch their leadership skills and make friends with like-minded youths outside of school.</p>

<p>The theme for DHAP 2020 is “Centrality at Core.” ASEAN Centrality refers to ASEAN enhancing their leadership role in the
regional architecture while encouraging individual ASEAN Member States to view national interests from a broader
perspective of ASEAN interests.</p>

<p>“Centrality at Core” encapsulates a core tenet ASEAN has been striving to infuse into its organisation. Amidst the
increasing geo-political competition, this calls for greater enforcement of a rules-based order in the region by ASEAN
while being discerning to the national interests of major powers. However, ASEAN pursuit of a greater leadership role
must be underpinned by the will of its member states to uphold collective regional interests. At the same time,
delegates here at DHAP 2020 can look towards this theme as a guide--to look beyond national boundaries and formulate
policies with a broader regional outlook.</p>
