            <h1>The Academics Board</h1>
            <p>The Academics Board is responsible for delegates’ intellectually stimulating and engaging debate sessions. Over the
            course of the conference, delegates are allocated to different councils with varying difficulties, where each council
            will discuss one to two topics. DHAP aims to provide the most suitable and favorable experience to approach some of the
            most pertinent topics in today’s day and age. ARF and AICHR are beginner-friendly councils, to provide new delegates
            with a guided debate, ensuring a safe and conducive environment for first-time delegates to kickstart their MUN journey!
            TELMIN, AIA and HCC includes discussion on more complex issues of Information & Communication Technology, Economic Zones
            Development as well as the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Last but not least, the Press Corps enriches delegates’ media literacy
            by posing fresh challenges to delegates, requiring them to distinguish between real and fake news.</p>
