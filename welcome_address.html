<p>On behalf of the organising committee, it is my privilege to welcome you to the thirteenth edition of the Dunman High
ASEAN Plus Summit (DHAP) 2020.</p>

<p>Since its inception in 2008, DHAP’s trademark focus on ASEAN has allowed students to understand the importance of ASEAN
to Singapore, training them to be critically aware of pertinent issues around the region. As we enter the year 2020,
DHAP serves as a checkpoint to analyse the progress made by ASEAN following the ASEAN Vision 2020 outlined in 1997.
Hence, DHAP 2020 would also see the introduction of more ASEAN-centric councils which would give delegates a
well-rounded view towards ASEAN.</p>

<p>This year, we will be accepting a maximum of 150 high school students aged 15 - 19 from schools in Singapore. This quota
imposed upon registration numbers is meant to enhance delegates’ experience here in DHAP 2020 through more meaningful
interactions between chairs and delegates alike. Other changes including the addition of non-governmental agencies will
also be introduced to contribute to greater diversity in debate. Finally, DHAP 2020 will also see the introduction of
new awards such as Best Delegation and Outstanding Delegation awards which encourages greater team spirit.</p>

<p>The theme for DHAP 2020 is “Centrality at Core”. It can be exemplified through ASEAN’s pursuit of a more active
leadership role on the global stage, while being sensitive to global developments through continuous engagements with
external powers such as the USA and China. It also reflects a commitment by the ASEAN Member States to align their
national interests with that of the association for greater collective growth. “Centrality at Core” also serves as a
challenge to delegates to formulate their interpretations of ASEAN Centrality. This is in hopes of allowing delegates to
understand the reasons underpinning efforts by ASEAN to maintain said centrality.</p>

<p>Through DHAP, we hope to provide a platform for both new and seasoned delegates to voice their opinions. Through active
participation in the conference, we hope delegates will hone the necessary skills to engage in the art of diplomacy,
nurturing them to become informed global citizens beyond the Model United Nations circuit. Delegates will also be able
to interact with participants from different backgrounds, coming together to instil a greater appreciation for ASEAN.</p>

<p>For more information on how to register for DHAP, please visit our webpage at http://dhaseanplus.com. We look forward to
welcoming your institution for DHAP 2020!
</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
