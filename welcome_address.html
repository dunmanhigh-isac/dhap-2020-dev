<p>On behalf of the organising committee, it is my privilege to welcome you to Dunman High ASEAN Plus (DHAP) Writes! 2020.
</p>

<p>In light of the Covid-19 situation, we will be shifting our focus towards a Writing Competition so as to continue
providing students within the Upper Secondary and Pre-University levels with a platform to deepen their understanding
towards international diplomacy and politics.
</p>

<p>Through DHAP Writes!, we hope that this competition would allow participants to hone their writing skills while
understanding the mechanics behind policy papers, directives and commentaries. While navigating through these uncertain
times, we also wish for participants to gain a deeper appreciation and understanding of regional organisations such as
ASEAN.
</p>

<p>For more information on how to register for DHAP Writes!, please visit our webpage at http://dhaseanplus.com. We look
forward to welcoming your institution for DHAP Writes 2020!
</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
