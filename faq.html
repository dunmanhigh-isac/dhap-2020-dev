<ol>

<li>
    <p><strong>Who can participate in DHAP Writes! 2020?</strong><br /><br />
        DHAP Writes! is targeted at students between the ages of 15 and 19. Registration of students who do not meet the age
        criteria will be processed on a case-by-case basis. Registration will be processed on a first-come, first-served basis
        and the organisers reserve the right to turn down registrants in the event of oversubscription.</p>

</li>

<li>
    <p><strong>How are the categories decided for the competition?</strong><br /><br />
        We will have two age group categories for students in:
        <ol type='i'>
            <li>Upper Secondary (Secondary 3 to 5)</li>
            <li>Junior Colleges and Millennial Institute</li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>Each category will then be divided into the different types of councils we have, including:</p>
        <ol type='i'>
            <li>ASEAN councils</li>
            <li>Press Corps</li>
            <li>Historical Crisis Council</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p><strong>Do I have a choice of council allocation?</strong><br /><br />
        Delegates will get to indicate their council preference when they register. However, allocations will be assigned by the
        Organisers upon registration. Upon confirmation, all allocations are final and we will not be entertaining requests to swap committees.
    </p>
</li>

<li> 
    <p><strong>Is this a Model United Nations Conference?</strong><br /><br />
        Unfortunately, no. Given the current Covid-19 situation, DHAP will be adapting to a writing competition instead this year.
    </p>
</li>

<li>
    <p><strong>How can I register for DHAP Writes! 2020?</strong><br /><br />
    Registration can be done through the form under the ‘<a href="registration.html">Registration</a>’ tab. The deadline for registration will be 30 April
    2359.</p>

</li>
<li>
    <p><strong>Is there a participation fee for DHAP Writes! 2020?</strong><br /><br />
        No payment is required for participation. DHAP Writes! 2020 is completely free of charge!
    </p>

</li>
<li>
    <p><strong>What logistics will be provided for the participants?</strong><br /><br />
        For academic materials, study guides are made available at the ‘<a href="resources.html">Resources</a>’ tab. Additionally,
        these study guides will also be sent to email addresses of registered students along with their council allocation upon
        release.</p>

</li>
<li>
    <p><strong>What awards are given out at DHAP Writes! 2020?</strong><br /><br />
        For ASEAN councils, the award of “Best Policy Paper” will be awarded to one participant in the upper secondary and tertiary
        category respectively. In the Historical Crisis Committee, the “Best Directive” will also be awarded to one delegate of
        the respective categories. Last but not least, “Best Commentary” award will be given in the Press Corps in a similar
        fashion. 2 participants will also receive “Special Commendation” at their council chairs’ discretion. Please refer to
        the tab ‘<a href="resources.html">Resources</a>’ on this website!.
    </p>

</li>

<li>
    <p><strong>What is the competition format like?</strong><br /><br />
        Students are to form groups of 2 to 4 students of the same age group before registration. The students in the same team
        need not be from the same school. Once successfully registered, students will work in these groups to complete a paper
        writing.
    </p>

</li>

<li>
    <p><strong>If I am not in Upper Secondary, JC, or MI, am I still allowed to register for this competition?</strong><br /><br />
    You may still register for the competition, but your registration will be processed on a case-by-case basis and the
    organisers reserve the right to turn down registrants.</p>

group, we still encourage application, nevertheless, and will
