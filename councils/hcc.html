<p>In this edition of DHAP Writes! 2020, the Historical Crisis Committee (HCC) has undergone a radical change in format,
where participants can expect to immerse themselves in a full military experience. Under a dynamic and fast-paced
environment, participants will be stretched to think of unconventional methods to manage the crisis in short amounts of
time while considering the potential implications of their actions.
</p>

<h2 id="the-1967-arab-israeli-war">The 1967 Arab-Israeli War</h2>

<p>The Historical Crisis Committee (HCC) takes participants back to 1967 as military officers of the Arab League. HCC will
depict one of the most well-known wars in modern history - The 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Also known as the Third
Arab-Israeli War, its outbreak can be attributed to the escalation of tensions as a result of the previous two
Arab-Israeli wars as well as underlying hostilities between Israel and its Arab neighbours. With the motives and actions
of both sides remaining controversial even after more than fifty years of its conclusion, participants will get the
opportunity to put their creativity and strategic thinking to the test by using any available resources to manage the
increasingly hostile Israeli actions in the region.

            <p>Having really diverse interests yet little time, Ryan is either spending his time playing sports or reading up on
            current affairs and fitting in the mugger lifestyle which he can never get used to. Due to his sleep-deprived nature,
            you may catch him in deep sleep and he wouldn't wake up until you annoy him real bad (he may just sleep through a
            natural disaster). Having been in the DHAP HCC team in 2019, Ryan once again hopes to be able to provide participants
            with a fulfilling experience and would like to wish participants all the best!

            <p>Mr Han Dongcheng, also known as Mr Steven Han, has demonstrated immense interest in exploring economics and
            econometrics. He wants to find a delicate balance between mathematics and humanities subjects. In HCC this year, he
            hopes through research, participants can be taken back to 1967 to experience the turmoil of dynamics and that they can
            attempt to rebuild the fabrics then.
