<p>Established in 1994, The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) brings together 27 member
states for dialogue on political and security issues of common interest within the Asia-Pacific. The acknowledgement of
its diverse membership has seen ARF advocate a measured approach towards security cooperation and open dialogue on
critical issues concerning its member states. This is evident from its adherence to ASEAN’s fundamental principles of
consensus and consultation.

<h2 id="1-the-question-of-e-commerce-in-the-asia-pacific">The Question of the South China Sea Dispute</h2>

<p>The decades-long dispute over the maritime boundaries and islands in the South China Sea
is one of the most pressing global security issues, with the Philippines, Vietnam, China,
Brunei, and Malaysia laying their respective territorial claims. The South China Sea holds
tremendous economic value, as it contains rich reserves of natural resources and hosts
about one-third of global shipping lanes. Participants can delve into this complex long-standing issue to come up with a
policy paper to manage inter-state tensions over the South China Sea.
</p>

<!--h2 id="2-the-question-of-arms-trafficking-in-southeast-asia">2. The Question of Human Trafficking</h2>

<p>Human trafficking has long been a major issue of concern, primarily because it is a serious violation of basic human
rights. The suffering caused is not just felt by the victims themselves, but also extends to their loved ones. Yet,
regardless of the amount of time that has passed, trafficking remains an unsolved problem around the world - Southeast
Asia included.
</p>

<p>More than 85% of human trafficking victims have been identified to be from within Asia. Countries of destination for
human trafficking include China, Malaysia and Thailand. In addition, a majority of the victims were females and children
made up almost a third of human trafficking victims. Many attempts have been made to counter the issue of human
trafficking. Hence, delegates must bear the already existing frameworks in mind, such as the ASEAN Plan of Action
Against Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, while crafting their resolutions.

                    <h3 id="head-chair">Head Chair</h3>

<p>Shiqi is a basic girl (as much as she hates to admit it) who likes to think that she’s the first to start trends. In her free-time, she enjoys basking in the beauty of music and nature. Otherwise, she is often busy with the hustle and bustle of Senior High life. She is excited to be chairing and hopes to meet all the delegates brought together by the conference.</p>

                    <h2>Ashley Lim Ruo Yun</h2>
                    <h3 id="chair">Chair</h3>

<p>Ashley is currently a year five student who constantly overthinks every aspect of her life. Her favourite subject is literature because it’s very human and lets her understand just a little bit more about the people around her. Also, she probably needs help for her milk tea addiction (but tries to ignore that fact regularly) and hopes that the delegates will enjoy the debate sessions at DHAP 2020!</p>

                    <h3 id="chair">Chair</h3>

<p>Nicholas is bubbly, kind-hearted, goofy and unique all at the same time. Yet he’s innovative and creative, always thinking out of the box to look for new solutions. In tough times he will always rise from the ashes like a phoenix with a fiery heart and never give up.</p>
