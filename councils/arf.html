<p>Established in 1994, The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) brings together 27 member
states for dialogue on political and security issues of common interest within the Asia-Pacific. The acknowledgement of
its diverse membership has seen ARF advocate a measured approach towards security cooperation and open dialogue on
critical issues concerning its member states. This is evident from its adherence to ASEAN’s fundamental principles of
consensus and consultation.

<h2 id="1-the-question-of-e-commerce-in-the-asia-pacific">The Question of the South China Sea Dispute</h2>

<p>The decades-long dispute over the maritime boundaries and islands in the South China Sea
is one of the most pressing global security issues, with the Philippines, Vietnam, China,
Brunei, and Malaysia laying their respective territorial claims. The South China Sea holds
tremendous economic value, as it contains rich reserves of natural resources and hosts
about one-third of global shipping lanes. Participants can delve into this complex long-standing issue to come up with a
policy paper to manage inter-state tensions over the South China Sea.
</p>

<!--h2 id="2-the-question-of-arms-trafficking-in-southeast-asia">2. The Question of Human Trafficking</h2>

<p>Human trafficking has long been a major issue of concern, primarily because it is a serious violation of basic human
rights. The suffering caused is not just felt by the victims themselves, but also extends to their loved ones. Yet,
regardless of the amount of time that has passed, trafficking remains an unsolved problem around the world - Southeast
Asia included.
</p>

<p>More than 85% of human trafficking victims have been identified to be from within Asia. Countries of destination for
human trafficking include China, Malaysia and Thailand. In addition, a majority of the victims were females and children
made up almost a third of human trafficking victims. Many attempts have been made to counter the issue of human
trafficking. Hence, delegates must bear the already existing frameworks in mind, such as the ASEAN Plan of Action
Against Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, while crafting their resolutions.

Year 5 student who was introduced to the world of MUN at UNASMUN’17. In her free time, she can be found communicating
with her friends with memes, or doing the renegade dance in her head. Despite being a huge fan of self-deprecating
humour, she believes in truly believing in oneself to achieve more. She hopes that DHAP Writes! 2020 sprinkles in a dash
of growth and a tablespoon of fun in participants’ lives.</p>
