<p>With the advent of fake news and its implications, news agencies, now more than ever, play an essential role of
informing the public. However, participants must balance the task of conveying information to their target audience with
the need to abide by the inherent biases of their respective news agencies. Participants of the Press Corps are not
tested on the typical skills required for Model United Nations. Instead, their linguistic abilities and capability to
pick up the nuances in the stances of news agencies will be challenged. Participants may choose any ONE of the following
two themes to write on:
</p>

<ol style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">
    <li>Resilience</li>
    <li>Multilateralism</li>

                <p>Xin Yi constantly zones out in class so much so that her seating arrangement is now right at the front of the class. The
                only time she shows interest in life is when new videos of her favourite kpop groups get uploaded. Although she can be
                quite blur at times, she vows to do her best in planning and hopes to create an enjoyable experience for every
                participant that wishes to join DHAP Writes! 2020!

                coffee too much. Hopefully, DHAP Writes! 2020 helps her relieve stress and simultaneously relax while reading your
                insightful position papers!
