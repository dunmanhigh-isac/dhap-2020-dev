<p>With the advent of fake news and its implications, news agencies, now more than ever, play an essential role of
informing the public. However, participants must balance the task of conveying information to their target audience with
the need to abide by the inherent biases of their respective news agencies. Participants of the Press Corps are not
tested on the typical skills required for Model United Nations. Instead, their linguistic abilities and capability to
pick up the nuances in the stances of news agencies will be challenged. Participants may choose any ONE of the following
two themes to write on:

<ol style="font-size: 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">
    <li>Resilience</li>
    <li>Multilateralism</li>
