<p>The ASEAN Investment Area Council (AIA), established by the ASEAN Economic Ministers, is working towards establishing a
free and open investment regime. Amid the ever-changing economic landscape, the pursuit of economic integration across
ASEAN has been a challenging task thus far. Hence, participants will be challenged to come up with strategies working
towards a more competitive investment environment in ASEAN.
</p>

<h2 id="1-the-question-of-e-commerce-in-the-asia-pacific">The Question of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Southeast Asia</h2>

<p>With SMEs playing a vital role in fuelling ASEAN’s economy, the competitiveness of SMEs will be inextricably linked to
the competitiveness of ASEAN as a global economic hub. However, there remains a lack of concrete steps to maximise their
contributions. In light of the volatile international developments, ASEAN has to tap into every available resource and
cannot afford to neglect small and medium enterprises. Participants of AIA must therefore explore the realms of
possibilities for greater collaboration between ASEAN’s SMEs, increasing their overall participation in the global value
chains. This would also mean challenging participants to suggest ways in elevating SMEs’ level of readiness for
integration into the various free trade agreements ASEAN is currently involved in.
</p>

<!--h2 id="2-the-question-of-arms-trafficking-in-southeast-asia">2. The Question of Economic Zones Development in Southeast Asia</h2>

<p>Evidence suggests that economic zones have helped the Member States in the region achieve industrial development and
develop export-oriented industries. Hence, developing more efficient economic zones amongst the ASEAN Member States
serves as a viable and versatile way to achieve closer ASEAN cooperation amidst the global slowdown. While individual
AMS have been capitalising on the advantages these economic zones provide, the variances in national policy and
institutional arrangements also lead to differing levels of success. Besides, the relentless pursuit to establish these
economic zones has also raised key issues with regards to budgetary constraints and environmental degradation. Delegates
will be expected to formulate policies which can continually provide sustenance and growth to these economic zones
across ASEAN. While delving into the intricacies of various strategies AMS embark on, delegates are also challenged to
craft solutions that could possibly provide a more streamlined approach to economic zones development across AMS.

            <h3 id="head-chair">Head Chair</h3>

            <p>Always in some state of panic or food coma, Nicholas constantly questions his life decisions as to why he chose to be in
            the Science stream in the first place. He began MUNning with the purpose of seeking refuge from numbers and formulae,
            but instead fell in love with the political jargon, endless research and chaos from unmoderated sessions. Besides that,
            a way to Nicholas’ heart would be a cute cat or two, or infinite cups of tea. He warmly welcomes all participants to
            DHAP Writes! 2020 and the AIA!

            <p>Joseph stepped foot into the world of MUN 3 years ago, unbeknownst and lost. Fortunately for him, his love for intense
            Unmods, bustling lobbying has blossomed ever since. Joseph is especially OBSESSED with “stonks”, and hopes AIA
            participants are equally passionate about it too!

            <p>Shian Pei often finds herself wondering why people are all sleep deprived and in a state of existential crisis. She
            would like participants to think on the bright side of life and get an abundance of sleep. She hopes all participants
            have sweet dreams of dominating the world through diplomacy and academia, and most importantly have a meaningful DHAP
