<p>The AICHR was inaugurated by ASEAN leaders in 2009, reflecting ASEAN’s commitment towards the strengthening of human rights efforts in the region. Until today, the AICHR has not resorted to any public action against human rights violations which occurred within ASEAN. Participants are required to think one step further to better draft policy papers encompassing effective solutions to resolve rights violations while taking into account ASEAN’s stance of non-intervention.

<h2 id="1-the-question-of-e-commerce-in-the-asia-pacific">The Question of Refugees from Conflict Zones</h2>

<p>The plight of Rohingyas has caught the eyes of many around the world, drawing greater scrutiny towards efforts being
made to tackle the issue. The escalation of the refugee crisis in Asia in recent decades has become one of the most
pressing global issues with millions being forced to flee from their homeland and resettle in foreign countries. While
ASEAN efforts to provide financial aid have alleviated some from extreme poverty, millions remain. The nature of such
crises could also be marked by years of historical animosity and discrimination against certain communities, making it
harder for policies to effectively counter these ingrained stereotypes. In this council, participants will also be
guided in the process of crafting solutions to one of the most pertinent issues while learning more about ASEAN’s
efforts in championing for human rights.

<!--h2 id="2-the-question-of-arms-trafficking-in-southeast-asia">2. The Question of the Freedom of Speech</h2>

<p>Freedom of expression enables the free exchange of ideas, opinions and information and thus allows members of society to
form their own opinions on issues of public importance. However, some ASEAN states have faced backlash for their disdain
towards the freedom of speech, imposing heavy censorship in the name of counter-terrorism and national security. The
discrepancy between the views of the ASEAN Member States and their main trading partners regarding freedom of speech, as
well as the possible implications of the aforementioned discrepancy, makes this issue all the more pressing to discuss.
Delegates can expect to stand at one of the sides pressuring or justifying their stance, thus coming up with feasible
solutions to alleviate the restriction of the freedom of expression on their people.
