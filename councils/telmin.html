        ASEAN Telecommunications and IT Meeting

<p>The First ASEAN Telecommunications Ministers Meeting (TELMIN) was held on 13-14 July 2001 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The
ASEAN ICT Masterplan 2015 marked 10 years of ICT
cooperation within AMS. In today’s day and age of digital connectivity, participants will be looking to craft measures
suited to bring ASEAN closer to its vision of a global ICT hub.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-question-of-e-commerce-in-the-asia-pacific">The Question of Information and Communication Technology in Education</h2>

<p>While the ASEAN Member States are increasingly cognisant of the need to develop their education systems with technology,
much still needs to be done to integrate ICT into ASEAN education to aid students directly in their learning. The
integration of ICT into education can also help AMS indirectly by enhancing the abilities of their future workforce.
Participants are expected to incorporate the technicalities of ICT into the familiar topic of education, by proposing
solutions that resolve typical issues regarding education in ASEAN with the support of ICT infrastructure in specific.
They are also reminded to be sensitive towards the discrepancy between the ICT capabilities of AMS.
</p>

<!--h2 id="2-the-question-of-arms-trafficking-in-southeast-asia">2. The Question of Information and Communication Technology in the ASEAN Single Market</h2>

<p>The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) has long established the transformation into a single market as one of its goals, and
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in particular has great potential to assist ASEAN in achieving said
goal. Not only should ICT goods and services be allowed to flow freely, but such goods and services must be effectively
used to nurture a suitable climate for businesses within AMS and ASEAN in its entirety.Whilst dealing with some
technical terms, delegates must also bring forth innovative yet feasible solutions that aid ASEAN in establishing a
single market in spite of the infrastructural gap, bearing in mind the fundamental goals of the AEC
